# Reimplementation of SWA Gaussian method and a bit of Subspace Inference to quantify uncertainty of DNNs

This repo (IA321 course at ENSTA Paris) aims at reimplementing SWAG method and compare it to a reproduction of the official repo.

In addition, a sampling method is added (```sample_parameters_acp```) to implement a version of the Subspace Inference paper (PCA subspace only)
